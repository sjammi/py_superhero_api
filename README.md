# sample_py_api
Sample Python API with live requests, DB configuration, and Endpoints

## Setup ##
This app assumes that postgres is installed on the system. I used Poetry to handle packages, but that's not required.

## Endpoints ##

## TODO ##
- Add tests
  - Unit testing: parsing logic, API endpoint logic
  - Integration testing: API connection

## Personal Notes ##
I prefer straight SQL when possible, but SQLAlchemy seemed like a better fit in this case since it handles DB and table creation.
